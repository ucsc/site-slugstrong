**Banana Slugs—we can’t wait for you to be back on campus this fall.**

Through the summer, UC Santa Cruz will be resuming more in-person activities to be ready for the start of fall quarter.

This site is meant to provide everyone in our campus community with crucial information as we resume more in-person research, teaching, and work. Together we are Slug strong.
