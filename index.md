  News and information about how the campus moves beyond COVID-19
---

Banana Slugs—we can't wait for you to be back on campus. UC Santa Cruz is carefully beginning to resume some on-campus research and in the coming months plans to increase other operations. 

COVID-19 requires us to rethink how we teach, research, and work. There are new policies, guidelines, and protocols that we must all follow to prevent the virus's spread. 

This site is meant to provide everyone in our community with all of the crucial information as we work toward resuming more and more in-person research, teaching, and work. 

This will continue to be an incredibly dynamic moment in our lives. Never before have Banana Slugs needed to move so fast and adapt so quickly.
