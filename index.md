**Banana Slugsâ€”we are so glad you're back!**

This site will continue to provide everyone in our campus community with crucial information as we resume more in-person research, teaching, and work. Together we are Slug strong.

The latest [COVID-19 Campus Guidelines and Resources booklet](https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/assets/images/ucsc-recovery-resiliency-briefing-booklet.pdf) provides a general update on how the UC Santa Cruz is supporting the health and well-being of faculty, staff and students.and new guidelines for meetings, events, and visitors.

Additionally, the campus [released a protocol to provide expectations related to events, meetings, and visitors](https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/assets/images/Event-Meeting-and-Visitor-COVID-19-Protocol.pdf).

***Note**: To mark the start of the fall quarter, all active faculty and staff were sent a Slug Strong fall welcome pack that included a reusable lunch bag, a face covering, and a few other items to use in their workspace. If you believe you should have received one, but did not, you can request one through an [online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHuWWSZE_MwwvtPzB9zrtKaPKHowXCp91vw8vhbd_ovAkPFA/viewform)."*
