## What is sequestration?
Sequestering means minimizing in-person interactions whether in the dorms, dining facilities or other on- or off-campus locations where individuals congregate or interact. Students should leave their residences only to participate in essential activities (e.g., to pick up meals or purchase food, participate in low-risk outdoor recreational activities, or obtain healthcare services).

Sequestration applies to all students— regardless of vaccination status—moving onto campus. They will need to test within 48 hours of arrival and sequester for a minimum of seven (7) days, during which time they must receive a negative PCR test through the campus testing program. Students will need to continue getting tested according to the current campus requirements and wear high-quality face masks, such as KN95 or a surgical mask worn beneath a cloth mask. Both KN95s and cloth masks are available for pickup at your college housing office. . 

## Throughout the sequestration period:

1. Practice the two basics of COVID-19 prevention: wear a face-covering outside of your room and frequently wash your hands.
2. Complete the Daily Symptom Check. 
4. No guests or visitors! No one is permitted in your room except you! If you live in an apartment, no one but you and your assigned apartment-mate(s) are allowed in the unit.
5. Do not leave your residence except to participate in essential activities (e.g., to pick up meals or purchase food, participate in low-risk outdoor recreational activities, or obtain healthcare services). 
6. No in-person gatherings. Residents under sequestration are not permitted to host or attend gatherings of any kind.
