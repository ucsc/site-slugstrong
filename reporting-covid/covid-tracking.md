The COVID-19 dashboard provides a regularly updated status on COVID-19 at UCSC. The UCSC testing data in the dashboard will be updated on those days when complete testing data is available for a 24-hour period during which asymptomatic testing was conducted. This data will help inform decisions about on-campus operations and activities.

The data includes the daily total number of tests run through the UCSC Molecular Diagnostic Lab and the daily total of new cases. The data is further broken down to the positive results for students living on-campus, students living off-campus, and employees.  The data also includes a seven-day average positivity rate for all tests performed through the campus testing program.

UCSC cautions against drawing broad conclusions from the data about the prevalence of COVID-19 on campus, particularly since the student data set includes symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and only data collected through the campus testing program.
