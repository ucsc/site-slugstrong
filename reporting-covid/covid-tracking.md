The COVID-19 dashboard provides a regularly updated status on COVID-19 at UCSC. Testing requirements for all students and employees that come to campus is dependent on vaccination status and evolving community conditions. [Learn more](https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/).

The UCSC testing data in the dashboard will be updated daily. This data will help inform decisions about on-campus operations and activities. A map of the recent campus work or residential locations of people who tested positive for COVID-19 is [available online](https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/safety-ih/campus_covid_cases.html). Cases include those reported by the UCSC Colligan Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory (from May 2020 through Dec. 31, 2021) and a third-party vendor (effective Jan. 1, 2022) and those cases self-reported by students and employees who received testing off campus.

The data is comprised of test samples collected through the campus testing program, including the UCSC Colligan Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory (from May 2020 through Dec. 31, 2021) and a third-party vendor (effective Jan. 1, 2022). The dashboard includes the daily total of new cases. New cases are shown on the day the sample was collected. The data is further broken down to the positive results for students living on-campus, students living off-campus, and employees. The data also includes a seven-day positivity rate for all tests performed through the campus testing program.

UCSC cautions against drawing broad conclusions from the data about the prevalence of COVID-19 on campus, particularly since the student data set includes symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and only data collected through the campus testing program and any cases that are self-reported by students or employees. In addition, data for prior days may change as more test results are received.
