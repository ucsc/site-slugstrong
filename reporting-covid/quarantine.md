UC Santa Cruz students and employees who test positive for COVID-19 on a laboratory test or home test, and those who are close contacts to cases (within 6â€™ for at least 15 minutes) will follow the isolation and quarantine instructions below. These instructions are consistent with the current [California Department of Public Health](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Guidance-on-Isolation-and-Quarantine-for-COVID-19-Contact-Tracing.aspx) and [Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency guidance](https://www.santacruzhealth.org/HSAHome/HSADivisions/PublicHealth/CommunicableDiseaseControl/CoronavirusHome/PublicInformation.aspx).  

Testing information is available on the Student Health Center website for [students](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-students.html#requirements) and for [employees](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-staff.html#start).

**Do not wait to be contacted by the Student Health Center to begin isolation or quarantine. Depending on the daily case and close contact volume, you may not be contacted.**

**Isolation and Quarantine Definitions**

* **Isolation**: separates people infected with a contagious disease from those who are not infected.
* **Quarantine**: restricts the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease in case they become infected.

Isolation and quarantine are proven public health interventions fundamental to reducing COVID-19 transmission. Isolation and quarantine processes are in place to slow the spread of the virus.

## Release from Isolation or Quarantine
**Employees and off-campus students** who have met the criteria to be released from isolation or quarantine may self-clear. You do not need to send in proof of a negative test, and you do not need to wait to be contacted by the Student Health Center for release or to return to campus.

**Residential students** in campus-provided isolation or quarantine housing will be notified by the Quarantine Coordinator when they can end their time in isolation. 

### Isolation Instructions (I am COVID-19 positive, what do I do?)
Everyone who tests positive, regardless of vaccination status:

* Should stay home for at least 5 days.
* Can end isolation on Day 6 if you are fever-free for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication and your other symptoms have improved 
* Should continue to wear a well-fitting mask around others at home and in public for 5 additional days (day 6 through day 10) after the end of your 5-day isolation period.
* A Rapid Antigen test (BinaxNOW, QuickVue) on or after Day 5 is recommended if you have access to one
* Should continue isolation if a fever is present and continue isolating until the fever resolves.
* Should continue isolating if symptoms, other than fever, are not resolving after day 10.
