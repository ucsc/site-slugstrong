**COVID-19 requires all of us to be even more attentive to our health, regularly checking for symptoms associated with the virus.**

Starting in fall quarter 2020, students living on campus or taking in-person classes must complete a [daily COVID-19 symptom screening survey and get regular COVID-19 tests](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-students.html).

All employees who work on-site at a UCSC property (owner or leased) must complete a daily COVID-19 symptom check questionnaire prior to reporting for work. Effective immediately, these employees must [enroll in the program](https://ucsantacruz.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_007UYZZnkIAUmkR). [Learn more](https://www.ucsc.edu/coronavirus/symptom-check.html) about the program.

Preventing the spread of COVID-19 is one of our highest priorities. UC Santa Cruz is responding to concerns from the campus community regarding COVID-19.

*   **Employees:** If you have tested positive for COVID-19, or were exposed to someone who tested positive, please email your supervisor.
*   **Supervisors:** Report confirmed COVID-19 cases or exposures to the COVID-19 Symptom Check Officer at [check@ucsc.edu](mailto:check@ucsc.edu).  Do not include additional health information.
*   **Students:** If you've tested positive for COVID-19, please call Student Health Services at 831-459-2591 so that medical staff members are aware and coordinate care if needed.

Santa Cruz County has [instructions online](http://www.santacruzhealth.org/Portals/7/pdfs/coronavirus/COVID-19_Patient_Instruction_Booklet_self_quarantine_and_self_isolation.pdf?version=052520) for people about how to self-quarantine if they have been exposed to someone with COVID-19. 

Campus leaders are taking all appropriate measures to protect our community and closely following the guidance of our state and nation’s top health leaders to ensure we continue to support the safety and well-being of our students, faculty, and staff.
