**COVID-19 requires all of us to be even more attentive to our health, regularly checking for symptoms associated with the virus.**

Starting in fall quarter 2020, students living on campus or taking in-person classes must complete a [daily COVID-19 symptom screening survey and get regular COVID-19 tests](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-students.html).

All employees who work on-site at a UCSC property (owner or leased) must complete a daily COVID-19 symptom check questionnaire prior to reporting for work. Effective immediately, these employees must [enroll in the program](https://ucsantacruz.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_007UYZZnkIAUmkR). [Learn more](https://www.ucsc.edu/coronavirus/symptom-check.html) about the program.

Preventing the spread of COVID-19 is one of our highest priorities. UC Santa Cruz is responding to concerns from the campus community regarding COVID-19.

*   **Employees:** If you have tested positive for COVID-19, or were exposed to someone who tested positive, please email your supervisor.
*   **Supervisors:** Report confirmed COVID-19 cases or exposures to the COVID-19 Symptom Check Officer at [check@ucsc.edu](mailto:check@ucsc.edu).  Do not include additional health information.
*   **Students:** If you've tested positive for COVID-19, please call Student Health Services at 831-459-2591 so that medical staff members are aware and coordinate care if needed.
