UC Santa Cruz students have a number of support and engagement services available to ensure their success as we transition back to in-person learning and interaction.

Student Health Services, Counseling and Psychological Services, Basic Needs support, Academic Advising, Learning Support Services, and CARE are open and providing services remotely.

As COVID-19 restrictions are eased, more campus resources are being offered in person.
