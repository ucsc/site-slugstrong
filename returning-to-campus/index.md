## Slug Strong Actions
Most COVID-19 requirements have been lifted, though some requirements and recommendations remain:

- **COVID-19 Testing:** The campus's extensive testing strategy, which was extremely effective in fall quarter 2021, is designed to lay a solid foundation for our spring quarter. Learn more about testing requirements [for students](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/protocol.html) and [for employees](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/protocol.html). [Schedule](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-faq.html#on_campus_covid_tests) a test online.
- **Obtain a booster when eligible** The UC system COVID-19 vaccination policy requires faculty, staff, and students to obtain a booster shot as soon as they are eligible. UCSC’s deadline for compliance with the booster requirement was Jan. 31, 2022. [Upload proof](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-faq.html#boosterupload) of your booster.
- **Face coverings:** Effective April 10, masks [will not be required for most indoor settings](https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/03/indoor-masking-policy-update.html) at UC Santa Cruz facilities, but their use will still be strongly recommended. Masks will still be required on campus public transportation, in the Early Education Services centers, and in clinical settings, such as the Student Health Center and at indoor COVID-19 testing sites. KN95 masks and surgical masks are availabe on campus many locations including the McHenry Library, the Science and Engineering Library, and the Bay Tree Bookstore.  [Learn more](https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/safety-ih/covid-resources.html) about requirements for face coverings.
- **Daily symptom checks:** Employees and visitors, including those who are vaccinated, must complete [daily symptom checks](https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/checking-for-symptoms/) when they are on-site, a requirement set by Cal/OSHA.
- **COVID-19 training:** [COVID-19 training](https://recovery.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/get-trained/) is still required for all employees who are on site at any UCSC facility. The current training is being revised, and we will pass along the revised information when it is ready.
- **UC vaccination policy:** With limited exceptions, [COVID-19 vaccinations are required](https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/07/systemwide-vaccination-policy.html) for all faculty, staff, academic appointees, and students accessing facilities at any UC campus this fall. Employees and students can [submit proof of vaccination online](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html#requirement) or [request an exemption](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html#exception).
