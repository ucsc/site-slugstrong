UC Santa Cruz operations are close to what was underway before the pandemic. All buildings will be accessible under regular summer operations starting July 1, 2021.

A [campus services webpage](https://recovery.ucsc.edu/support-for-students/campus-services/) provides information about what is open during summer. Information is also available on the office and department websites.

Most COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted, though some remain:

- **Face coverings:** UC Santa Cruz [recommends that everyone, regardless of vaccination status, wear a face covering](https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/07/revised-mask-reccomendation.html) when accessing shared campus indoor spaces, particularly those that are open to the general public.
- **Daily symptom checks:** Employees, including those who are vaccinated, must complete [daily symptom checks](https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/checking-for-symptoms/) when they are on-site, a requirement set by Cal/OSHA.
- **COVID-19 training:** [COVID-19 training](https://recovery.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/get-trained/) is still required for all employees who are on site at any UCSC facility. The current training is being revised, and we will pass along the revised information when it is ready.
- **Asymptomatic testing protocol:** Unvaccinated students (undergraduate and graduate) living in university housing or who are on-site for any reason are required to have [weekly COVID-19 tests](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid19.html).
- **UC vaccination policy:** [COVID-19 vaccinations will be mandatory](https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/07/systemwide-vaccination-policy.html) for all faculty, staff, academic appointees, and students accessing facilities at any UC campus this fall. Employees and students can [submit proof of vaccination online](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html#requirement) or [request an exemption](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html#exception).
