UC Santa Cruz operations are close to what was underway before the pandemic. All buildings are accessible under regular summer operations, effective July 1, 2021.

A [campus services webpage](https://recovery.ucsc.edu/support-for-students/campus-services/) provides information about what is open during summer. Information is also available on the office and department websites.

Most COVID-19 requirements have been lifted, though some requirements and recommendations remain:

- **Face coverings:** UC Santa Cruz [requires that everyone, regardless of vaccination status, wear a face covering](https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/face-coverings/) when accessing shared campus indoor spaces, particularly those that are open to the general public. [Learn more](https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/safety-ih/covid-resources.html) about requirements for face coverings.
- **Daily symptom checks:** Students and employees, including those who are vaccinated, must complete [daily symptom checks](https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/checking-for-symptoms/) when they are on-site, a requirement set by Cal/OSHA.
- **COVID-19 training:** [COVID-19 training](https://recovery.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/get-trained/) is still required for all employees who are on site at any UCSC facility. The current training is being revised, and we will pass along the revised information when it is ready.
- **Asymptomatic testing protocol:** Unvaccinated students (undergraduate and graduate) living in university housing or who are on-site for any reason are required to have [COVID-19 tests](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid19.html) at least every four days.
- **UC vaccination policy:** With limited exceptions, [COVID-19 vaccinations are required](https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/07/systemwide-vaccination-policy.html) for all faculty, staff, academic appointees, and students accessing facilities at any UC campus this fall. Employees and students can [submit proof of vaccination online](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html#requirement) or [request an exemption](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html#exception).

**Support for managers and supervisors:** Have questions? [Visit Office Hours with Staff HR and EH&S](https://shr.ucsc.edu/covid-19-resources/covid-office-hours.html)Â on Fridays starting at 1 p.m.
