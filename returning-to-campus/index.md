## Slug Strong Actions
Most COVID-19 requirements have been lifted, though some requirements and recommendations remain:

- **COVID-19 Testing:** The campus's extensive testing strategy, which was extremely effective in fall quarter 2021, is designed to lay a solid foundation for our winter quarter. Learn more about testing requirements [for students](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/protocol.html) and [for employees](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/protocol.html). [Schedule](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-faq.html#on_campus_covid_tests) a test online.
- **Obtain a booster when eligible** The UC system COVID-19 vaccination policy requires faculty, staff, and students to obtain a booster shot as soon as they are eligible. UCSC’s deadline for compliance with the booster requirement is Jan. 31, 2022. [Upload proof](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-faq.html#boosterupload) of your booster.
- **Face coverings:** UC Santa Cruz [requires that everyone, regardless of vaccination status, wear a face covering](https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/safety-ih/covid-resources.html) when accessing shared campus indoor spaces, particularly those that are open to the general public. Employees and students are encouraged to use a high quality mask, such as a KN95 or a surgical mask beneath a cloth mask. KN95 masks and surgical masks are availabe on campus many locations including the McHenry Library, the Science and Engineering Library, and the Bay Tree Bookstore.  [Learn more](https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/safety-ih/covid-resources.html) about requirements for face coverings.
- **Daily symptom checks:** Students, employees and visitors, including those who are vaccinated, must complete [daily symptom checks](https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/checking-for-symptoms/) when they are on-site, a requirement set by Cal/OSHA.
- **COVID-19 training:** [COVID-19 training](https://recovery.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/get-trained/) is still required for all employees who are on site at any UCSC facility. The current training is being revised, and we will pass along the revised information when it is ready.
- **UC vaccination policy:** With limited exceptions, [COVID-19 vaccinations are required](https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/07/systemwide-vaccination-policy.html) for all faculty, staff, academic appointees, and students accessing facilities at any UC campus this fall. Employees and students can [submit proof of vaccination online](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html#requirement) or [request an exemption](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html#exception).
