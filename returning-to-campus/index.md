## Updated guidelines for new guidelines for meetings, events, and visitors
UC Santa Cruz is [recommending](https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/12/winter-quarter-update.html) faculty and staff hold meetings and events remotely during the first two weeks of January. The campus's [guidelines for meetings, events, and visitors](https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/assets/images/Event-Meeting-and-Visitor-COVID-19-Protocol.pdf) were updated on November 18, 2021. 

The [campus guidelines and resources booklet](https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/assets/images/ucsc-recovery-resiliency-briefing-booklet.pdf) provides additional information about campus operations.

## Slug Strong Actions
Most COVID-19 requirements have been lifted, though some requirements and recommendations remain:

- **COVID-19 Testing:** The campus's extensive testing strategy, which was extremely effective in fall quarter 2021, is designed to lay a solid foundation for our winter quarter. Learn more about testing requirements [for students](https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/12/return-to-campus.html) and [for employees](https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/12/return-to-on-site-work.html). [Schedule](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-faq.html#on_campus_covid_tests) a test online.
- **Obtain a booster when eligible** The UC system COVID-19 vaccination policy requires faculty, staff, and students to obtain a booster shot as soon as they are eligible. UCSC’s deadline for compliance with the booster requirement is Jan. 31, 2022. [Upload proof](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-faq.html#boosterupload) of your booster.
- **Face coverings:** UC Santa Cruz [requires that everyone, regardless of vaccination status, wear a face covering](https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/face-coverings/) when accessing shared campus indoor spaces, particularly those that are open to the general public. [Learn more](https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/safety-ih/covid-resources.html) about requirements for face coverings.
- **Daily symptom checks:** Students, employees and visitors, including those who are vaccinated, must complete [daily symptom checks](https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/checking-for-symptoms/) when they are on-site, a requirement set by Cal/OSHA.
- **COVID-19 training:** [COVID-19 training](https://recovery.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/get-trained/) is still required for all employees who are on site at any UCSC facility. The current training is being revised, and we will pass along the revised information when it is ready.
- **Asymptomatic testing protocol:** UC Santa Cruz has [released fall 2021 testing requirements](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid19.html) for both unvaccinated students and employees and availability for vaccinated students and employees. Unvaccinated students (undergraduate and graduate) living in university housing or who are on-site for any reason are required to have [COVID-19 tests](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid19.html) at least every four days. Unvaccinated staff and faculty who come on-site for any reason are also required to test at least every four days.
- **UC vaccination policy:** With limited exceptions, [COVID-19 vaccinations are required](https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/07/systemwide-vaccination-policy.html) for all faculty, staff, academic appointees, and students accessing facilities at any UC campus this fall. Employees and students can [submit proof of vaccination online](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html#requirement) or [request an exemption](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html#exception).
