## Together we can curb COVID-19
More than ever, it’s important to take care of our own health and do our part to reduce the spread of COVID-19. 

UC Santa Cruz recommends that everyone, regardless of vaccination status, wear a face covering when accessing shared campus indoor spaces, particularly those that are open to the general public. 

Cloth face coverings serve to keep each of us from sharing respiratory “droplets” with those around us. Given the community spread of COVID-19 throughout Santa Cruz County and the Bay Area, some people may have been infected but will not have symptoms for several days, while others may be carriers of the virus but never show symptoms. Current information indicates that these people can unintentionally infect others around them.

Reusable cloth face coverings can be made from readily available items such as scarves, bandanas, or neck gaiters, as well as fitted masks that can be made at home or obtained online.

UCSC employees and students are welcome to use their own cloth face coverings. In addition, the campus is coordinating with campus partners to procure reusable cloth face coverings for essential staff working on campus and students living in on-campus housing who are unable to provide their own. Please note, these will be non-medical grade face coverings.  Priority will be given to essential staff working on campus in close quarters and in confined indoor spaces, including dining services, housing staff, and custodial services.
