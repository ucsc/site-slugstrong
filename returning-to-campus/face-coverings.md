## Together we can curb COVID-19
More than ever, it’s important to take care of our own health and do our part to reduce the spread of COVID-19. 


Everyone in our community should adopt six practices to stay Slug strong: physically distance, wear a face covering, avoid gathering in groups, keep your hands and equipment clean, get tested if you have COVID-19 symptoms, and inform your supervisor if you're sick.

### Share information
Let people know about the Strong Slug effort by adding it to your email signature. Instructions are available [online](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V3fi_dugczdT8ZOspqySfHYtkqxFxYNVUYgOM2eeWcE/edit?usp=sharing).

### Wear a Face Covering
Californians and Banana Slugs must wear face coverings in common and public indoor spaces and outdoors when distancing is not possible. [Read more](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Face-Coverings_06-18-2020.pdf) about the guidance and limited exceptions. 

Cloth face coverings serve to keep each of us from sharing respiratory “droplets” with those around us. Given the community spread of COVID-19 throughout Santa Cruz county and the Bay Area, some people may have been infected but will not have symptoms for several days, while others may be carriers of the virus but never show symptoms. Current information indicates that these people can unintentionally infect others around them.

Reusable cloth face coverings can be made from readily available items such as scarves, bandanas, or neck gaiters, as well as fitted masks that can be made at home or obtained online.

UCSC employees and students are welcome to use their own cloth face coverings. In addition, the campus is coordinating with campus partners to procure reusable cloth face coverings for essential staff working on campus and students living in on-campus housing who are unable to provide their own. Please note, these will be non-medical grade face coverings.  Priority will be given to essential staff working on campus in close quarters and in confined indoor spaces, including dining services, housing staff, and custodial services.

### Social Distancing Protocol

UCSC is taking the following measures to ensure the health of faculty, staff, students, patients and their families:

* Everyone who can carry out their work duties from home has been instructed to do so.
* Employees shall not come to work if they are sick. Do not enter UCSC facilities if you are sick. 
* UCSC requires all faculty, staff, and students to maintain 6 feet of distance when moving about on campus. Abstain from physical contact, including shaking hands.
