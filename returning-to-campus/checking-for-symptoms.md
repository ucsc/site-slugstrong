**COVID-19 requires all of us to be even more attentive to our health, regularly checking for symptoms associated with the virus.**

### For students
Starting in fall quarter 2020, all students living on campus or taking in-person classes must complete a daily COVID-19 symptom screening survey and get regular COVID-19 tests. [Read more](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-students.html). 

### For employees
All employees who work on-site at a UCSC property (owner or leased) must complete a daily COVID-19 symptom check questionnaire prior to reporting for work. Effective immediately, these employees [must enroll in the program](https://ucsantacruz.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_007UYZZnkIAUmkR).

Once [registered](https://ucsantacruz.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_007UYZZnkIAUmkR), employees will receive a daily symptom questionnaire each morning at 3 a.m. Employees must complete this questionnaire at home, before coming to work.  The questionnaire is brief and should take less than four minutes to complete.

Employees who are not working on-site consistently, but making occasional visits to work on-site, must complete a [Symptom Check Questionnaire](https://ucsantacruz.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7WXdjRMMuOrb0yh) for each instance that they come to campus to work on-site.

For employees working at the main campus, select your location, region, then your specific building. See [map](https://ucsc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=519c606a04f04957be9d8f14af8a735e) for reference.

### For visitors
All scheduled and unscheduled visitors to the UC Santa Cruz owned or leased property must complete the UCSC Visitor COVID-19 Symptom Check Questionnaire prior to entering the campus for each day when entering the campus. 

Visitors are defined as anyone who is not a UC Santa Cruz employee (faculty, staff and other academic appointees) or student, and who will be entering on-site at a UCSC owned or leased property.  The following is the link for the [online UCSC Visitor COVID-19 Symptom Check Questionnaire](https://ucsantacruz.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_24vMSiDcxZp6VRX).

### Privacy information
Questionnaire results will be used for limited purposes, e.g. only be used for COVID-19 exposure contact tracing notification or for workers’ compensation claims. Questionnaire responses will not be maintained in employee personnel files. Responses will be stored in a secure, HIPAA compliant application and purged after 60 days.
