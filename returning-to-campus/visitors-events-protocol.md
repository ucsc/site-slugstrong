# COVID-19 Visitors and Events Protocol
***Updated 4/22/22***
 
Public health agency requirements and guidelines regarding COVID-19 mitigation protocols change regularly. The information below summarizes current guidance for campus visitors and events. Some programs may have additional requirements, such as performances through the [Arts Division](https://arts.ucsc.edu/covid-protocols), the [Seymour Center](https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/visit/), and the [UCO Lick Observatory](https://www.lickobservatory.org/events/#:~:text=Starting%20April%2010th%2C%20wearing%20a,the%20start%20of%20the%20event). Prior to coming to campus, visitors should check with program organizers for the most up-to-date protocols. 

This protocol remains in effect while the [Santa Cruz County COVID-19 Community Level](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view?list_select_state=California&data-type=CommunityLevels&list_select_county=6087) remains “low.” Additional mitigations may be required if the County Level reaches “medium,” and some events may be postponed or rescheduled if the County Level reaches “high.”

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements for Campus Visitors</h2>

**All campus visitors** must follow campus COVID-19 mitigation requirements:
* Do not come onto campus or enter any University facilities or physical spaces if you feel unwell or have recently tested positive for COVID-19. 
* For registered volunteers, complete the [Daily Symptom Survey](https://ucsantacruz.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_24vMSiDcxZp6VRX) and be prepared to show proof of clearance prior to entering UCSC facilities and physical spaces. 
* For visitors other than registered volunteers, completing the [Daily Symptom Survey](https://ucsantacruz.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_24vMSiDcxZp6VRX) is *recommended* prior to entering UCSC facilities and physical spaces. 
* [Face coverings](https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/08/face-coverings-guidance.html) are *recommended* for everyone, regardless of vaccination status. 
* Campus visitors who do not comply with policies will not be permitted to access the facility and will be asked to leave.

**Casual visitors**, who are individuals without specific meetings or appointments, have no requirements beyond the recommendation to wear face coverings in all shared indoor spaces.

**Visitors from outside California** should follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) travel guidance. Additionally, individuals who are not [up to date](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) with COVID-19 vaccinations must also: 
* Obtain and have accessible a record of a negative COVID-19 test 1-3 days prior to travel.
* Self-quarantine for 5 days upon arrival.
* Obtain and have accessible a record of a negative COVID-19 test result 3-5 days after arrival.
* If a COVID-19 test is positive, the visit should be canceled or postponed before the visitor arrives on campus, or as soon as the result is received.

## Visitors to Student Housing and Dining

Currently, there are no guest restrictions in student housing and dining but campus visitors must comply with the following in addition to the requirements for all campus visitors:
* Visitors must be hosted by a residential student at all times and access is limited to the residential student’s assigned living area.
* The University may amend the UCSC Housing Visitor/Guest Policy, including implementing a “no guest” policy for residential students, as needed to attempt to reduce the spread of COVID-19 or to comply with public health orders or guidance. Students will be given notice via UCSC email if a residential “no-guest” restriction is put into place or modiﬁed.

## Events at UCSC Locations

“Event” means any planned gathering where 25 or more people are in attendance or are reasonably anticipated to be in attendance at a UCSC location, including but not limited to celebrations, dances, lectures, forums, performances, social gatherings, concerts, speaker presentations, conferences or athletic contests or tournaments. Events do not include regularly scheduled academic classes, seminars, labs, or non-campus sponsored events where a third party rents a campus facility for a private event (e.g., a wedding reception).

## Indoor Events

* Proof of being up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations or a recent negative COVID-19 test result (taken within 72 hours of the start of an event) are not required for indoor events. Event organizers may choose to require these measures as long as they apply to all attendees.
	* The host or event coordinator should provide attendees reasonable notice of the requirements of the event in advance. If proof of being up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations or a negative test is required, the entrance requirements can be met in the following ways:
		* Any attendee can show their CDC Vaccine Card (phone image acceptable) or digital vaccine record from the State of California. International attendees may show their translated vaccine record.
		* Any attendee can show a negative COVID-19 test result from the last 72 hours (must be a lab PCR test; home tests/antigen tests are not valid).
* Attendees who do not meet speciﬁed event requirements will not be permitted entry.
* Event organizers *may require* face coverings for specific events, such as those with the possibility of high density or close contact, although doing so is not required at this time. 
* Accurate attendee registration is recommended for all events to aid in contact tracing if needed.
* If food or beverages are served during the indoor event, attendees should have the option to eat their meal outdoors if they desire.

## Outdoor Events
* Proof of being up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations or a recent negative COVID-19 test result (taken within 72 hours of the start of an event) are not required for outdoor events. Event organizers may choose to require these measures as long as they apply to all attendees.
* Event organizers may require face coverings for specific events, such as those with the possibility of high density or close contact, although doing so is not required at this time.

## “Mega Events”
[Mega-events](https://covid19.ca.gov/mega-events/) are deﬁned by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) as indoor events with 1,000 or more people and outdoor events with 10,000 or more people. 
* Proof of being up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations or a recent negative COVID-19 test result (taken within 72 hours of the start of an event) are not required for mega-events. Event organizers may choose to require these measures as long as they apply to all attendees.
* Event organizers are strongly encouraged to consider requiring face coverings for mega-events where there is the possibility of high density or close contact, although doing so is not required at this time.

## Campus Tours

All visitors, regardless of vaccination status, who are participating in on-site and/or self-guided tours of campus are required to abide by the following:
