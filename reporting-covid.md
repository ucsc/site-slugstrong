Preventing the spread of COVID-19 is one of our highest priorities. UC Santa Cruz is responding to concerns from the campus community regarding COVID-19.

*   **Employees:** If you have tested positive for COVID-19, or were exposed to someone who tested positive, please email your supervisor and the Office of Emergency Services (Lisa Ehret, director) at [oes@ucsc.edu. ](mailto:oes@ucsc.edu. )
*   **Students:** If you've tested positive for COVID-19, please call Student Health Services at 831-459-2591 so that medical staff members are aware and coordinate care if needed.

Santa Cruz County [announced its first confirmed](http://www.santacruzhealth.org/Portals/7/Pdfs/Coronavirus/COVID-19%20PR%203_6_20_FINAL.pdf) case on March 7 and [currently has 257 cases](http://santacruzhealth.org/HSAHome/HSADivisions/PublicHealth/CommunicableDiseaseControl/Coronavirus.aspx).
